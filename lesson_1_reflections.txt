How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing different versions through the diff -u function allows you to see the differences between the old and new file. A (-) indicates that something has been removed and is no longer in the new file, while a (+) indicates that something has been added to the new file that was not previously in the old file. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Access to different versions quickly will allow you to spot bugs faster by comparing versions. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: more flexibility and can choose more logical points with a managable number of versions.
Con: human error, might forget, 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git projects are very interlated and you need to know what happens in several files to make a complete picture. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log tells you the entire commit history while git diff tells you the difference between two specific committs 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can alwas go back and fix it because bugs should be easy to spot. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control for front end development
