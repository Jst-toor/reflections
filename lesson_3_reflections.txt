When would you create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Create a remote repository when working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You should pull changes manually because having auto updates would create too many commits and jumble your history. Doing this manually allows you to commit everytime you make a logical change.
